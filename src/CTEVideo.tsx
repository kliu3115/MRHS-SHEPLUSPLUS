            <h1> HCPSS STEM/CTE Course Introduction Video </h1>
            <h3>This was probably SHE++'s biggest project yet! We were tasked with making an updated STEM/CTE course introduction video for the incoming high schoolers. This process involved conducting interviews with teachers and students, as well as gathering lots of video/photo content. We spent countless hours editing the video and creating helpful graphics to depict the different STEM pathways students could take. We are very proud of how the video turned out!</h3>
