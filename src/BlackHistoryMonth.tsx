            <h3>In honor of Black History Month, SHE++ tasked its members with researching some notable female figures in STEM. Members were tasked with working in groups of 3 or less and researching a prominent, African-American woman in STEM. This was then broadcast to the school during the morning announcements over the course of just over a week.</h3>
