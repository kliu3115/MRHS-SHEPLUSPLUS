            <h3> Peer Mentoring was an intiative SHE++ set up and facilitated to help STEM students get the help they needed. At times, it can be hard to speak up and ask for help openly. Our goal with this project was to enable students to get connected with a mentor/mentee and earn some service hours while they were at it! </h3>
